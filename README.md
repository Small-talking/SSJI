# SSJI
A simple server jar installer in a small bat file.
A complete rewrite from the previous version.

## How to run:
In Windows, just run the file like any normal Application. This will open your commandfile and it will let you install a specific minecraft server jar, out of [Serverjar's](https://serverjars.com/#servers) collection.
Have fun!

(Only supports Windows atm.)
