# SSJI
A simple server jar installer in a small bat file.
A complete rewrite from the previous version.

## How to run:
SSJI only support Windows as of right now. It will let you install a specific minecraft server jar, out of [Serverjar's](https://serverjars.com/#servers) collection.
Have fun!

(Only supports Windows atm.)

## Too simple?
This project was made in 20-30 Minutes max. I will perhaps update this once or twice and change some ways of installing the actual Minecraft Jar (Perhaps making this a Node.js App and directly getting the jar through Serverjars API and not by opening browser tabs.)
Welp, sorry! (I guess.)
